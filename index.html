        <br/>
        <p>There are currently five planets classified as dwarf planets: 
            Ceres, Pluto, Makemake, Haumea and Eris. Except for Ceres, 
            which lies in the main asteroid belt, these small planets are 
            located in the Kuiper Belt. They’re considered dwarfs because 
            they are massive, round, and orbit the Sun, but haven't cleared
            orbital path.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Planets in Our Solar System</p>
        <br/>
        <p>The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, 
            Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon.</p>
        <p>From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three 
            times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight 
            would be as much as seven times brighter. Despite its proximity to 
            the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – 
            that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Second planet from the Sun and our closest planetary neighbor, Venus 
            is similar in structure and size to Earth, but it is now a very 
            different world. Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction most 
            planets do. Its thick atmosphere traps heat in a runaway greenhouse 
            effect, making it the hottest planet in our solar system—with surface 
            temperatures hot enough to melt lead. Glimpses below the clouds reveal 
            volcanoes and deformed mountains.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we 
            know of so far that’s inhabited by living things.</p>
        <p>While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it 
            is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface. 
            Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four 
            planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.</p>
        <p>The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets, except for 
            Earth, were named after Greek and Roman gods and goddesses. However, the 
            name Earth is a Germanic word, which simply means “the ground.”</p>
        <br/>
        <p>The fourth planet from the Sun, Mars is a dusty, cold, desert world with a 
            very thin atmosphere.</p>
        <p>This dynamic planet has seasons, polar ice caps and weather and canyons and 
            extinct volcanoes, evidence it was once an even more active past.</p>
        <p>Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only 
            planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape. NASA currently has 
            three spacecraft in orbit, one rover and one lander on the surface. India and 
            ESA also have spacecraft in orbit above Mars. These robotic explorers have found 
            lots of evidence that Mars was much wetter and warmer, with a thicker atmosphere, 
            billions of years ago. NASA launched the next-generation Perseverance rover to 
            Mars on July 30,2020.</p>
